# MSc_AI_Capstone_Project
Capstone Project for Masters of Science in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Galway

This GitHub repository is for maintaining the code for the task of jersey number recognition for the capstone project as part of the MSc in AI course at the University of Galway.

SoccerNet-v3 dataset was used for this project. The dataset was sourced from SoccerNet, a comprehensive, large-scale dataset designed for soccer video understanding. The complete dataset consists of a few hundred frames long sequences of players' tracking videos on the soccer field. A sample of the dataset is given inside the 'Dataset' directory. The complete dataset can be accessed from https://www.soccer-net.org/data#h.b1lf96jmxlcc

The code for this project is in two parts:

<ul>
  <li>Dataset_Preparation.ipynb contains the code for loading and saving the data into a single Numpy array for further processing and training</li>
  <li>MSc_Final_Capstone_Project.ipynb contains the main code for training the Video Vision Transformer (ViViT) for the task of jersey number recognition</li>
</ul>
